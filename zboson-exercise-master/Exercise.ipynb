The histogram that was created earlier will help in this task.\n",

    "After running the code Jupyter will print the values of the different parameters as a result of the optimization. Also uncertainties of the values and a graph of the fitted function are printed. The uncertainties will be received from the covariance matrix that the fitting function `curve_fit` will return."

In these interactions muons will lose some of their energy. This messes up slightly the fitting of the trajectories of the muons and the measurement of the transverse momentum. It also effects to the situation that the measurement of the transverse momentum is easily depended for example from the orientation of the muon chambers, from the division of the material of the detector and from the magnetic field.
